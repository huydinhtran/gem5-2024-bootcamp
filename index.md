Welcome to the gem5 Bootcamp!

[Register for the 2024 gem5 Bootcamp](https://na.eventscloud.com/ereg/index.php?eventid=799532&){: .btn .btn-lg .btn-primary}

As the premier destination for computer architecture enthusiasts and researchers, our bootcamp offers an immersive experience into the world of architectural simulation and modeling.
Whether you're a student eager to learn, a professional looking to sharpen your skills, or a researcher seeking to push the boundaries of technology, the gem5 Bootcamp is your gateway to mastering the gem5 simulator.

Join us to explore the intricate workings of modern computer systems, engage with experts in the field, and collaborate with peers from around the globe.
With hands-on sessions, in-depth tutorials, and challenging projects, you'll gain practical knowledge and experience that will propel your understanding and innovation in computer architecture.

Dive into the dynamic world of simulation with the gem5 Bootcamp, and emerge equipped to tackle the computational challenges of tomorrow.

We also held a [gem5 Bootcamp in 2022](https://gem5bootcamp.github.io/gem5-bootcamp-env/) which you can check out for more information.
Videos from that bootcamp are available [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orASbQ02pDw&list=PL_hVbFs_loVSaSDPr1RJXP5RRFWjBMqq3).

## Tentative schedule for 2024

The bootcamp will be held from July 29th to August 2nd, 2024.
The bootcamp will run from 9am-4pm each day in the [UC Davis Conference Center](https://conferencecenter.ucdavis.edu/).

The full five day registration runs Monday-Friday.
The three day registration runs Tuesday-Thursday.

This script demonstrates the use of integers as a primative data type in
Python.

# Integers as a primative data type in Python. They "whole numbers" and are
# declared like so. Here we declare a variable `x` and assign it the literal
# value `1`.
x = 1
print(f"Value of x: {x}")

# Integers can be set using arithmetic operations of literals or other
# integers variables.

# Set variable `y`` to `10 + 5`.`
y = 10 + 5
print(f"Value of y: {y}")

# Set variable `z` to `y - x` (in this case, 15 - 1).
z = y - x
print(f"Value of z: {z}")

# Multiplication
multi_xy = x * y
print(f"Value of multi_xy: {multi_xy}")

# Division
div_xy = y / x
print(f"Value of div_xy: {div_xy}")

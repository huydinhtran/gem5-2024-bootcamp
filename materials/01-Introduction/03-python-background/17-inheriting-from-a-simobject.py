#It's useful in gem5 to take a SimObject and extend it to add new functionality.
# gem5 should ideally be open for extension but closed for modification.
# Modifying gem5 code directly can be difficult to maintain and can lead to
# merge conflicts when updating to new versions of gem5.

# Below is an example of spcializing a gem5 SimObject to create an abstract
# L1 cache. This can be used as a base class for L1 instruction cache.
# L1 cache and L1 instruction cache.

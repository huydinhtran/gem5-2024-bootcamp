## gem5 Tests

To check that your changes to gem5 work, you should run some of our gem5 tests.

---

## Contributing and testing

In general, we would like to ask that all contributions come with tests.

In practice, if we asked for tests this way we would receive no contributions.

### Our outlook on testing

- If a feature isn't tested, we don't "support it" (e.g., DRAMSim3).
- If the "gem5 developers" want to add a supported feature, we are usually the ones to add a test.
- Adding tests takes time away from fixing bugs, adding new features, etc.

---

## gem5 Test Categories

We run tests on the gem5 codebases regularly to ensure that changes do not break the code.
These tests exist in four main categories;

1. **CPP Unit tests**: These are tests that run C++ code. In gem5, we use the Google Test framework.
2. **Python Unit tests**: These are tests that run Python code. In gem5, we use the Python unittest framework.
3. **TestLib Tests**: These are tests that run gem5 simulations, verify exit codes, and compare output to expected output ("testlib" is the name of the framework used to do this).
4. **Compilation Tests**: Tests which compile gem5 under different configurations with different compilers/environments.

> There are some tests we run which don't fit into these categories, but these are the main ones.

---

## gem5 Test Schedule

1. **CI Tests**: These tests are run on every pull request to gem5, and every update to any pull request. The CI tests consist of the CPP and Python unit tests and a subset of the TestLib tests and Compilation tests. These are designed to run "quickly" (by gem5 standards), in under 4 hours.
2. **Daily Tests**: These tests are run every day on the gem5 codebase.
These tests consist of the larger Testlib tests. They typically take 12 hours or more to complete.
3.  **Weekly Tests**: These tests are run weekly on the gem5 codebase.
These tests consist of the largest Testlib test suite and the Compilation tests. These tests typically take 1 to 2 days to complete.
4. **Compiler Tests**: These tests are run every week.
These run a cross product of gem5 compilation targets and compilers the project currently supports. These tests usually take around 12 hours to complete.

---

## GitHub Actions

The complete GitHub Actions workflow for these tests can be found in the [.github/workflows/](https://github.com/gem5/gem5/blob/v24.0/.github/workflows) in the gem5 repository.

We not go over these in this session but you can look over these yaml files and see how GitHub Actions is triggered to run these the gem5 tests.

These tests run on "self-hosted" runners. There is a machine at Wisconsin (loupe) which runs these tests.

> Bonus points if you know what a "loupe" is

---

## CPP Unit tests

[src/base/bitfield.test.cc](https://github.com/gem5/gem5/blob/v24.0/src/base/bitfield.test.cc) is a typical example of a CPP unit test in gem5.

It is a GTest. More information on GTest can be found at <https://google.github.io/googletest/>

The SConscript file in the same directory as the test file is used to build the test.

```python
GTest('bitfield.test', 'bitfield.test.cc', 'bitfield.cc')
```

The format is `GTest(<test_name>, <test_source>, <source_files>)`.

---

### Running the CPP Unit Tests

You can run all unit tests with  `scons build/ALL/unittests.opt` command.

To run a specific test:

```shell
scons build/ALL/base/bitfield.test.opt
./build/ALL/base/bitfield.test.opt
```

---

## Python Unit Tests

[tests/pyunit/util/pyunit_convert_check.py](https://github.com/gem5/gem5/blob/v24.0/tests/pyunit/util/pyunit_convert_check.py) is a typical example of a Python unit test in gem5.

More information on Python's unittest framework can be found at <https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html>

The tests are run with `gem5 tests/run_pyunit.py` command.
In our case, any file in the "tests/pyunit" directory with the prefix "pyunit_" is considered a test by the test runner.

Individual subdirectories in "tests/pyunit" can be specified and run separately by passing those subdirectories as arguments to "tests/run_pytests.py". E.g.: `gem5 tests/run_pyunit.py --directory tests/pyunit/util`.

---

## Compiler Tests

Compiler tests are run weekly on the gem5 codebase.

These tests are specified directly in a GitHub Action workflow: [.github/workflows/compiler-tests.yaml](https://github.com/gem5/gem5/blob/v24.0/.github/workflows/compiler-tests.yaml)

These tests use a series of Docker images to test compilation of various gem5 configurations with different compilers.

If your system deviates from what we test in the compiler-tests, we do not support that compiler.

---

## TestLib Tests

TestLib is a library we developed to help run gem5 integration tests.

> There is some regret on rolling our own testing framework. It increases the maintenance burden and doesn't provide much benefit.

TestLib tests are the most important tests in gem5.
These tests run gem5 simulations and verify the output of the simulation.
The tests are written in Python and use the "testlib" framework to run the simulations and verify the output.

We do not have very good coverage of unittests, so most of our testing is in integration tests via the TestLib.

---

## Using TestLib

The tests are run using the `./main.py` command in the `test` directory of the gem5 repository.

It's useful to just focus on a subdirectory of tests when running tests:

```shell
./main.py run gem5/memory
```

The above will only run the "quick" tests in the "tests/gem5/memory" directory.
The "quick" tests are the testlib tests run in the CI pipeline. To run the tests in the "daily" or "weekly" test suites, you can use the `--length` to specify `long` or `very-long` (`quick` is the `length` default).

---

## Using TestLib

The `./main.py list` command can be used to list all the tests in a directory, which we'll demonstrate here:

```shell
# List all the long tests in tests/gem5/memory: Those run in the Daily Tests.
./main.py list --length long gem5/memory

# lists all the very long tests in tests/gem5/memory: Those run in the Weekly Tests.
./main.py list --length very-long gem5/memory
```

---

## How TestLib Tests are declared

Let's look at ["tests/gem5/m5_util"](https://github.com/gem5/gem5/blob/v24.0/tests/gem5/m5_util) to see how a test is declared.

In this directory there is "test_exit.py".
Any file with the prefix "test_" is considered a test by the testlib framework and will be automatically run when the tests are executed.

"configs" is a directory of configuration scripts that are used to run the tests defined in "test_exit.py".

Now, let's look into "test_exit.py" and see how the tests are declared.

---

## Declaring how to test

Import testlib library (found in `gem5/ext/testlib`)

```python
from testlib import *
```

Many of the tests use regex matching. For example, we check to see if the `m5_exit` instruction is encountered below and then create a *verifier*.

**`verifier`** is used by the testlib to check the output.

```py
m5_exit_regex = re.compile(
    r"Exiting @ tick \d* because m5_exit instruction encountered"
)
a = verifier.MatchRegex(m5_exit_regex)
```

---

<!-- _class: code-80-percent -->

## Declaring the test

Now, we use a special function `gem5_verify_config` to run gem5 and then apply our verifier.

```py
gem5_verify_config(
    name="m5_exit_test", # The test name
    verifiers=[a], # The verifier (must be iterable!)
    fixtures=(),
    config=joinpath( # The path to the config file to run.
        config.base_dir,
        "tests", "gem5", "m5_util", "configs", "simple_binary_run.py",
    ),
    config_args=[ # The arguments to pass to the config file.
        "x86-m5-exit",
        "--resource-directory",
        resource_path,
    ],
    valid_isas=(constants.all_compiled_tag,),
)
```

---

## Valid ISAs parameter

The ISAs to run on this test. In this cases "ALL/gem5.opt" is used.

- `constants.arg_tag`: "ARM/gem5.opt"
- `constants.x86_tag`: "X86/gem5.opt"
- `constants.riscv_tag`: "RISCV/gem5.opt"


While not specified directly we could determine whether the tests runs as `quick`, `long`, or `very-long` with a `length` which accepts `constants.quick_tag`, `constants.long_tag`, or `constants.very_long_tag` as arguments (default is `constants.quick_tag`).

---

## Viewing the tests

```shell
./main.py list gem5/m5_util
```

## Running the tests

Then run with

```shell
./main.py run gem5/m5_util
```

**Note**: This will try and build "ALL/gem5.opt" each time you run the tests.
This can be time consuming.
You can pre-build the ALL/gem5.opt build with `scons build/ALL/gem5.opt -j$(nproc)` then, when running `./main.py run gem5/m5_util` add the `--skip-build` flag to skip the build step: `./main.py run --skip-build gem5/m5_util`.

If you want/need to build at this step, pass `-j$(nproc)` to the `./main.py run` command.

---

## Exercise: Creating a TestLib Test

Go to [materials/06-Contributing/02-testing/01-testlib-example](../../materials/06-Contributing/).

Move "01-testlib-example" to "tests/gem5/" in the gem5 repository.

Provided in "test_example.py" is the `gem5_verify_config` function which is used to define testlib tests.

```python
gem5_verify_config(
    name="test-example-1", # Name of the test. Must be unique.
    verifiers=(), # Outside exit-code zero check, additional  to be added.
    fixtures=(), # Fixtures: this is largely deprecated and can be ignored.
    config=joinpath(), # The path to the config script.
    config_args=[], # The arguments to be passed to the config script.
    valid_isas=(constants.arm_tag), # Need to run on ARM ISA
    length=constants.quick_tag, # A quick test to run in the CI pipeline
)
```

---

## In this exercise we will do the following:

1. Create a test that runs the `example_config.py` script without any arguments and verifies it runs correctly.
2. Have this test use the `--to-print` argument to print "Arm Simulation Completed." at the end of the simulation.
3. Update this test with a verifier that checks the output of the simulation after the run is complete.
4. Write a second test that does the same as the first test but with a different output message (inclusive of a verifier).

After each step run the tests to verify the changes:
`./main.py run gem5/01-testing-example`

---

## Hints and tips

- Adding `-vvv` to the end of the test command will give you more information about the test, particularly if an error occurs.
- Look at the other tests in "tests/gem5" for examples of how to write tests.
- You can pre-build the ARM/gem5.opt build using

```bash
scons build/ARM/gem5.opt -j$(nproc)
```

Then, when running `./main.py run gem5/02-testing`, add the `--skip-build` flag to skip the build step.

The completed examples can be found at [materials/06-Contributing/02-testing/01-testlib-example/completed](/materials/06-Contributing/02-testing/01-testlib-example/completed).
